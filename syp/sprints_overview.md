# :running: Sprint Overviews

Following steps are taken in order to keep the Sprint dates:  
- **📅 Bi-weekly Sprint Reviews**  
  - Each team member provides a short update on progress, blockers, and next steps. 

- **📉 Burndown Chart**  
  - Visual representation ([Timeline Chart](https://github.com/riosarah/AiKita.Planning/blob/main/README.md))  of the progress to track remaining tasks.  
  - Helps assess if the team is on track or if adjustments are needed.

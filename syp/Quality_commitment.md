# Quality Assurance Principle Statement

**Quality Assurance (QA)** is a foundational principle of our development process. 
We embed quality into every stage of our development lifecycle — from design to deployment. 
The following QA practices and goals define our standard:

## General QA Guidelines

1. **Test Coverage**
   - A minimum of **80% unit test coverage** must be achieved and maintained throughout the codebase.
   - All features and bug fixes must be covered by **automated tests** before merging.

2. **Performance Standards**
   - The app must support **100 concurrent users** with response times **under 2 seconds** for all major actions.
   - Performance tests will be conducted for each major release.

3. **Usability Testing**
   - **Hallway usability testing** (quick tests with random users) will be applied as soon as individual features are functional.
   - **Field testing** will be conducted as user stories reach integration status — to test end-to-end flow with target user groups.
   - Usability feedback will be looped directly back into product iterations.

4. **Constant QA Integration**
   - Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines will automatically run unit and performance tests.
   - Code reviews will include QA checks for logic correctness, edge cases, and test presence.

5. **QA Culture**
   - QA is not a phase, it is a **mindset**. Every team member is responsible for upholding the quality standard.
   - We actively seek **qualitative feedback** from users, developers, and testers, and apply it continuously.
